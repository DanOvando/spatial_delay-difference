Description
=============

SpatialDelayDiff
* Is an R package for simulation, estimating, visualizing, and evaluating the performance of (1) delay-difference models, (2) mean-weight models, and (3) age-structured surplus production models, each with spatial and nonspatial versions.
* Contains a spatial simulator for generating spatial data, and for reducing it down to nonspatial indices of average weight and abundance


Instructions
=============
First, please install TMB (Template Model Builder) here: 
https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp

Next, please use R version >=3.1.1 and install the package:


    # Install package
    install.packages("devtools")
    library("devtools")
    install_github("James-Thorson/spatial_delay-difference")
    # Load package
    library(SpatialDelayDiff)

Please see examples folder for an example of how to run the model:
